# Information Extraction Service Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented task 4.2: "Implement LLM information extraction service" with all required components:

- ✅ OpenAI API client with JSON mode configuration
- ✅ Entity and relationship extraction with strict JSON parsing
- ✅ Comprehensive prompt templates and response validation
- ✅ Retry logic and error handling for API failures
- ✅ Full test coverage and demonstration scripts

## Files Created

### Core Implementation
- `server/services/ie_service.py` - Main IE service implementation (580+ lines)
- `server/test_ie_service.py` - Comprehensive test suite (400+ lines)
- `server/test_ie_basic.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `server/test_ie_integration.py` - Integration tests
- `server/demo_ie_service.py` - Demonstration script

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. OpenAI API Client Configuration
- Async OpenAI client with proper initialization
- JSON mode configuration for structured output
- Model validation for JSON mode support
- Graceful handling when OpenAI library is not available

### 2. Entity and Relationship Extraction
- Comprehensive extraction prompt with detailed instructions
- Support for all defined entity types (Concept, Library, Person, Organization, Paper, System, Metric)
- Support for all relationship types (uses, implements, extends, contains, relates_to, authored_by, published_by, compares_with, depends_on, influences)
- Salience scoring for entities (0.0-1.0)
- Confidence scoring for relationships (0.0-1.0)

### 3. Strict JSON Parsing and Validation
- Robust JSON parsing with error handling
- Pydantic model validation for all extracted data
- Entity type validation with graceful skipping of invalid types
- Relationship validation with entity existence checking
- Evidence quote processing with character limits (≤200 chars)
- Source span tracking for provenance

### 4. Retry Logic and Error Handling
- Exponential backoff with jitter for API failures
- Configurable retry attempts (default: 3)
- Comprehensive error types:
  - `IEServiceError` - Base exception
  - `LLMAPIError` - API-related errors
  - `JSONParsingError` - JSON validation errors
- Graceful degradation for partial failures
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 5. Advanced Features
- Concurrent processing of multiple chunks with semaphore limiting
- Text offset calculation for evidence quotes
- Entity canonicalization support (ID generation via SHA256)
- Processing time tracking
- Empty text handling
- Comprehensive input validation

## API Interface

### Main Service Class
```python
class InformationExtractionService:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", 
                 max_retries: int = 3, base_delay: float = 1.0, max_delay: float = 60.0)
    
    async def extract_entities_relations(self, chunk_text: str, doc_id: str, chunk_index: int = 0) -> IEResult
    
    async def extract_from_chunks(self, chunks: List[str], doc_id: str, max_concurrent: int = 2) -> List[IEResult]
```

### Convenience Function
```python
async def extract_entities_relations(chunk_text: str, doc_id: str, api_key: str, 
                                    chunk_index: int = 0, model: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106") -> IEResult
```

## Extraction Prompt Template

The service includes a comprehensive 2000+ character prompt that:
- Defines all supported entity and relationship types
- Provides clear extraction rules and guidelines
- Specifies exact JSON output format
- Includes examples and constraints
- Ensures consistent, high-quality extractions

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Service initialization and configuration
- ✅ Prompt generation and validation
- ✅ JSON parsing with valid and invalid inputs
- ✅ Entity type validation and filtering
- ✅ Relationship validation and entity checking
- ✅ Text offset calculation
- ✅ Error handling for all failure modes
- ✅ Retry logic with mock API failures
- ✅ Concurrent processing
- ✅ Empty input handling

### Demonstration Results
- Successfully parses complex JSON with 3 entities and 2 relationships
- Correctly handles invalid entity types by skipping them
- Properly calculates text offsets for evidence quotes
- Gracefully handles missing OpenAI dependency
- Demonstrates all supported entity and relationship types

## Integration Points

The IE service integrates seamlessly with:
- Text chunking service (`services/text_chunking.py`)
- Core data models (`models/core.py`)
- Future canonicalization engine (task 4.3)
- FastAPI endpoints (task 5.2)
- WebSocket broadcasting (task 6.2)

## Performance Characteristics

- Concurrent processing with configurable limits (default: 2 concurrent requests)
- Exponential backoff prevents API rate limiting
- Efficient JSON validation with early error detection
- Memory-efficient processing of large document sets
- Processing time tracking for performance monitoring

## Error Resilience

- Handles OpenAI API failures with retry logic
- Graceful degradation for partial extraction failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Input validation prevents malformed requests
- Timeout handling for long-running requests

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 1.2**: "WHEN text chunks are processed THEN the system SHALL extract entities and relationships using LLM with strict JSON output format"

The implementation fully satisfies this requirement with:
- Strict JSON mode configuration
- Comprehensive validation of all extracted data
- Support for all required entity and relationship types
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Full test coverage demonstrating functionality

## Next Steps

The IE service is ready for integration with:
1. Task 4.3: Entity canonicalization engine
2. Task 5.2: Text ingestion endpoint
3. Task 6.2: Real-time update broadcasting

The service provides a solid foundation for the knowledge extraction pipeline with production-ready error handling, testing, and documentation.
